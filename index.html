<a id="welcome-to-my-work" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-my-work" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my work.</h2>

<p>My name is Sohan Choudhury, and over the summer preceding my senior year at Fairfield Warde High School I spent 10 weeks at the Yale School of Medicine (YSM) Department of Hematology researching under Dr. Manoj M. Pillai and in direct conjunction with bioinformatician Dr. Anil Kesarwani. This project site is dedicated to my work at the lab.</p>

<a id="two-tools-one-objective" class="anchor" href="#two-tools-one-objective" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Two tools. One objective.</h2>

<p>The vast majority of my time at the Pillai Lab (<a href="https://github.com/pillailab" class="user-mention">@pillailab</a>) was spent developing the two bioinformatics tools which are detailed below. Throughout development, debugging, and everything in between, I enhanced my knowledge in the field of computational biology as well as in coding using Python.</p>

<a id="fasta--bed-to-fasta-file-converter" class="anchor" href="#fasta--bed-to-fasta-file-converter" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FASTA &amp; BED to FASTA file converter</h3>

<p>The first program I developed program converts FASTA genome sequences and BED queries into a single FASTA file for easy use and access. The output file is both printed and stored. This tool took me approximately 2 weeks to complete. </p>

<p>Notable features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Conversion of sequence to RNA</li>
<li>
<code>parser</code> style user input</li>
<li>Utilizes Python3</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="cryptic-splice-site-identifier" class="anchor" href="#cryptic-splice-site-identifier" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cryptic Splice Site Identifier</h3>

<p>Given an annotation file (either GTF or GFF3) as well as a STAR .tab file containing splice junctions, this program will find all non-canonical splice sites. The processing works in all cases: whether 3', 5', or both splice sites are cryptic. Output is printed and saved, contains key information for analysis. This tool took me approximately 8 weeks to complete.</p>

<p>Notable features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple .tab files can be used simultaneously, as user has option to input .txt file containing paths of an unlimited number of .tab files</li>
<li>Output contains both cryptic splice junction as well as nearest annotated case</li>
<li>Output also provides distance of novel case from canonical case, as well as directionality of each case</li>
<li>Saved output is tab delimited for hassle-free analysis using spreadsheets such as Excel, also contains number of uniquely mapped reads for each case for easy statistical significance calculations for each novel case</li>
<li>
<code>parser</code> style user input</li>
<li>Utilizes Python 3</li>
</ul>
