Pillai and in direct conjunction with bioinformatician Dr. Anil Kesarwani. This project site is dedicated to my work at the lab.\r\n\r\n## Two tools. One objective.\r\nThe vast majority of my time at the Pillai Lab (@pillailab) was spent developing the two bioinformatics tools which are detailed below. Throughout development, debugging, and everything in between, I enhanced my knowledge in the field of computational biology as well as in coding using Python.\r\n\r\n### FASTA & BED to FASTA file converter\r\n\r\nThe first program I developed program converts FASTA genome sequences and BED queries into a single FASTA file for easy use and access. The output file is both printed and stored. This tool took me approximately 2 weeks to complete. \r\n\r\nNotable features:\r\n- Conversion of sequence to RNA\r\n- `parser` style user input\r\n- Utilizes Python3\r\n\r\n### Cryptic Splice Site Identifier \r\n\r\nGiven an annotation file (either GTF or GFF3) as well as a STAR `.tab` file containing splice junctions, this program will find all non-canonical splice sites. The processing works in all cases: whether 3', 5', or both splice sites are cryptic. Output is printed and saved, contains key information for analysis. This tool took me approximately 8 weeks to complete.\r\n\r\nNotable features:\r\n- Multiple `.tab` files can be used simultaneously, as user has the option to input .txt file containing paths of an unlimited number of `.tab` files\r\n- Output contains both cryptic splice junction as well as nearest annotated case\r\n- Output also provides distance of novel case from canonical case, as well as directionality of each case\r\n- Saved output is tab delimited for hassle-free analysis using spreadsheets such as Excel, also contains number of uniquely mapped reads for each case for easy statistical significance calculations for each novel case\r\n- `parser` style user input\r\n- Utilizes Python 3\r\n\r\n## Contact.\r\n_www.linkedin.com/in/sohanchoudhury_\r\n\r\n_sohanyo@gmail.com_",
